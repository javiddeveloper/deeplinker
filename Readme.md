- **Save clips:** Allows users to save frequently used components like Scheme, Host, and Path for later use.
- **Manage clips:** Displays a list of saved clips below each input field and allows users to replace the current input with a saved clip or delete it.
- **Simple UI:** Easy-to-use interface with a button to save all clips.
